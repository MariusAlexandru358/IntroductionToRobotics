    Introduction to Robotics Homework Repository

## About
This is my personal GitHub repository, a dedicated space for all the engaging laboratory homework assignments I've tackled during my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Here, you'll find a collection of captivating robotics challenges that have enriched my understanding of this dynamic field.

## What's Inside?
For each homework assignment I've compiled the clear task requirements and/or description, implementation details, a photo of my hardware setup and a link to a video showcasing functionality. This has been a voyage of discovery, where I've combined theoretical insights with hands-on coding and experimentation. 

## Key Features

- **Theory and Practice**: Approaching each assignment with utmost professionalism has helped me deepen my theoretical knowledge and sharpen my practical skills.

- **Code and Images**: Well explained code and visual exemplification are paramount to one's better understanding of the task at hand.
