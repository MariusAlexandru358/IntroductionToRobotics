    Introduction to Robotics Homework Repository

## About
This is my personal GitHub repository, a dedicated space for all the engaging laboratory homework assignments I've tackled during my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Here, you'll find a collection of captivating robotics challenges that have enriched my understanding of this dynamic field.

## What's Inside?
For each homework assignment I've compiled the clear task requirements and/or description, implementation details, a photo of my hardware setup and a link to a video showcasing functionality. This has been a voyage of discovery, where I've combined theoretical insights with hands-on coding and experimentation. 

## Key Features

- **Theory and Practice**: Approaching each assignment with utmost professionalism has helped me deepen my theoretical knowledge and sharpen my practical skills.

- **Code and Images**: Well explained code and visual exemplification are paramount to one's better understanding of the task at hand.

# Homework

## Homework #1 - RGB
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.

### Components:
- Arduino UNO
- Breadbord
- RGB LED (1)
- Potentiometers (3)
- 330&#x2126; Resistors (3)
- Wires as needed

### Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green and Blue. The control must leverage digital electronics.

### Breakdown
This is a straightforward task. All we have to do is read the values from the potentiometers (these are analog values), map them to the 0-255 interval, and write the resulting value to the LED pin. Of course, each potentiometer corresponds to one color of the RGB LED.
